# AWS Lambda Start Server

> AWS Lambda function that starts a server.

## Usage

Download the [zip](https://github.com/SamVerschueren/aws-lambda-stop-server/releases) file and deploy it as a lambda function. The name of the
lambda function can be something like `OfficeHoursLauncher`.

After you deployed the lambda function, you navigate to `Event sources` and choose for the `Scheduled Event`. Provide a name for your scheduled event,
for instance `OfficeHoursLaunchSchedular`. The following expression will run the lambda function every weekday at 7:45 AM.

```
cron(45 7 ? * MON-FRI *)
```

The lambda function will start all the instances that have a tag `LaunchGroup` with the value being the name of your lambda function, in this case for instance
`OfficeHoursLauncher`.

### IAM Roles

Make sure your lambda function is able to describe and start instances.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "MyStatementId",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:StartInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
